# üîé Insights & Recommendations

_This write‚Äëup summarizes what the dashboards reveal across **Sales, Products, Profitability, Customers, Stores, OPEX/Operations, and Shipment** pages. Numbers are directional (screen captures); use the underlying measures for exact values._

## Executive Summary (2016‚Äì2020)
- **Scale:** Sales ‚âà **8 bn** (multicurrency) vs **Plan ‚âà 9 bn** ‚Üí **Achievement ~90.9%**.
- **Profitability:** Reported **Profit/Margin value ~8 bn** with **ratio ~94%**. This is unusually high; see **caveat** below.
- **Trend:** Growth from 2016 ‚Üí **peak around 2019**, then **decline in 2020** (macro effects). Quarter view shows outsized Q1 contribution.
- **Mix:** **Mobile Devices** dominate revenue; Computers, Accessories, Audio follow; **Components** smallest.
- **Store performance:** **Costco, K‚ÄëMart, Best Buy, Staples** lead; long tail of smaller stores underperforms plan.
- **Fulfilment:** **100% shipped** with **avg delivery ‚âà 4.1 days** (max ‚âà 10). **Tuesdays** show slowest deliveries in the weekday chart.
- **OPEX control:** **Achievement ‚âà 98%**; plan and actual OPEX closely track at the year and category levels.

> **Caveat ‚Äî Profit 94%**: If this is **Gross Margin%**, 94% suggests `COGS` excludes most cost elements. Confirm scope: your DAX defines `COGS = SUMX(Sales, Quantity * Cost of goods)` and `Margin% = (Sales ‚àí COGS) / Sales`. Validate that `Cost of goods` is true cost and that freight/discounts/returns are handled; otherwise report it as **Contribution%**.

## Sales page
- **Sales by Year:** Climb through 2017‚Äì2019; **2020 down** materially vs 2019. Monitor YoY rebound.
- **Sales by Stores:** Clear leaders (**Costco, K‚ÄëMart, Best Buy, Staples**). Gap to mid‚Äëtier retailers is large.
- **Quarter mix:** Q1 bar ~highest. Consider smoothing seasonality in plan.
- **Category contribution:** Mobile Devices are ~top driver; Components least.

**Actions**
1. Revisit **plan calibration** (2019‚Üí2020 shift) and set **seasonality factors** in `SalesPlan`.
2. Drive **price/volume programs** on mid‚Äëtier stores; replicate winning playbooks from Costco/K‚ÄëMart.
3. Protect **Mobile Devices** availability (lead SKUs), but grow **Computers/Accessories** with bundles.

---

## Products page
- **Top brands by quantity:** **Dell, Huawei, HP, Samsung** lead the chart.
- **Top 5 subcategories:** Phones clearly #1; Desktop, Laptop next; Mice and Speakers strong value contributors.
- **Margin%** generally high across leading subcategories; maintain mix toward high‚Äëmargin SKUs.

**Actions**
1. Create **brand‚Äëspecific dashboards** (price bands, promos, returns) for Dell/Huawei/HP/Samsung.
2. Pair **Phone** category with **Accessory** bundles to raise **AVG receipt**.
3. Watch **long‚Äëtail SKUs**; prune or reposition low‚Äëvelocity items.

---

## Profitability page
- **Development over the period:** Sales, Plan, and Profit move together; peak ~2019, low in 2020.
- **Geo:** Profit concentrated in major cities (KZ primary markets), but some cities underperform.
- **By Category:** Mobile Devices deliver the biggest absolute profit; Computers next.

**Actions**
1. Flag cities with **high sales but low profit%** for **cost‚Äëto‚Äëserve** review (last‚Äëmile, returns, discounting).
2. If **Profit%** is meant to be **Gross Margin%**, validate `COGS` and consider including freight/allowances; otherwise rename KPI to **Contribution%** in the UI/README.

---

## Customers page
- **Sales & AVG receipt by occupation:** Highest volumes from **Office** and **Engineer** segments; **AVG receipt** declines across segments.
- **Acquisition sources:** **Advertisement** and **Internet** dominate the treemap; **Friends/Word‚Äëof‚Äëmouth** meaningful; **Radio** smaller.
- **Brand preference by age:** Panels show distinct patterns between **above 55 / 45‚Äì55 / below 45** cohorts.

**Actions**
1. Build **cohort slices** in the report (age √ó brand) to steer **targeted promotions**.
2. Double down on **digital channels** that convert (Internet/Ads); test referral incentives.
3. Track **AVG receipt** by segment and attach **attachment‚Äërate** KPIs (e.g., accessories per phone).

---

## Stores page
- **Sales & Plan by store:** Top stores are also closest to plan; many smaller stores miss plan materially.
- **Salespeople distribution:** `Walmart` shows the largest headcount; star icons highlight top sizes.
- **Geo:** Sales by city map mirrors profitability: large clusters in major KZ cities.

**Actions**
1. Deploy a **store segmentation** (A/B/C tiers) and align **targets** and **inventory depth** by tier.
2. Benchmark **sales per salesperson**; redeploy staff or training to low‚Äëproductivity stores.
3. Use **StoreSize √ó Brand** visuals to tailor brand‚Äëspace allocations (Dell/Samsung/Huawei/HP).

---

## Operations (OPEX) page
- **KPI tiles:** **OPEX Achievement ~98%**, Plan and Fact OPEX ~10M (directional).
- **By year & category:** Actuals track plan closely; categories like **Salary/Marketing** dominate spend.
- **By store size:** Large and medium stores consume most OPEX; achievement ~97‚Äì99% everywhere.

**Actions**
1. Move **store OPEX** to a **driver‚Äëbased model** (StoreSize, traffic, tills) for fair allocation.
2. Tie **OPEX Achievement** targets to **Net Profit** improvements (e.g., cost per revenue).

---

## Shipment page
- **KPIs:** **Shipped% 100%**, **Units ~2M**, **MAX delivery ~10 days**, **AVG ~4.06 days**.
- **By weekday:** **Tuesday** spikes to ~5 days; weekends lowest (~3 days).
- **By city:** Narrow band (~3.8‚Äì4.2 days); opportunities to pull the tail left.
- **By store:** **Costco** highest shipped quantity; some stores show higher AVG delivery vs peers.

**Actions**
1. Add a **weekday SLA** with Tuesday remediation (carrier capacity or cut‚Äëoff optimization).
2. Publish a **city/store delivery league table**; reward top performers.
3. Track **%Shipped ‚â§ 3 days** as a service KPI alongside the average.

---

## Measurement & Data Notes
- **Currency toggle:** `dimCurrency[symbol]` switches between Base and **KZT**; ensure `Calendar[KZT]` is dense daily (carry‚Äëforward monthly rates).
- **Plan vs Actual:** Ensure `SalesPlan` grain aligns to **Store √ó Month** and currency.
- **Margin% definition:** If profit tiles represent gross margin, validate `COGS` scope. Otherwise label as **Contribution%** in the UI and docs.
- **Shipment metrics:** Use the inactive relationship `Sales[Shipment date]` ‚Üí `Calendar[Date]` via `USERELATIONSHIP` (already in measures).

---

## Next 30‚Äëday roadmap
1. **Rename/confirm Profit%** in visuals & docs; add footnote on COGS scope.  
2. **Create ‚ÄúPlan Diagnostics‚Äù page** (variance waterfall: price, mix, volume, distribution).  
3. **Introduce Service KPIs** (`P80 delivery days`, `% ‚â§ 3 days`) and a **weekday control chart**.  
4. **A/B test bundles** in Mobile Devices to lift AVG receipt and attach rate.  
5. **Store productivity** deck: sales per salesperson, per sqm; actions for bottom quartile.
